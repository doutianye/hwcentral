1	"A water tank has steps inside it. A monkey is sitting on the topmost step (i.e., the first step). The water level is at the ninth step.He jumps 3 steps down and then jumps back 2 steps up. In how many jumps will he reach the water level? (Hint : try to write it in sequence of 3+(-2)+3+(-2).... = 8 as 9-1=8)"	As on each jump the monkey goes 3 steps forward and two back we get that he is  going down one step every 2 jumps but since he is going 3 down in one jump therefore number of jumps  =[(9-1)-3]X2 +1 = 11 jumps	"Number of jumps taken = 3 ,as he goes 3 down every jump 3+3+3=9"	He will never reach the water as he is not going downwards at all. Infinite Jumps	"The number of jumps taken will be equal to the number of steps = 9 ,as he goes 1 down every jump"		5	m
